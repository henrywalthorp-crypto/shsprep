# How to Study for the SHSAT: 10 Proven Strategies That Actually Work

The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) is unlike any exam most 8th graders (or 9th graders) have faced before. It's long, it's challenging, and there's no partial credit — you either get the score or you don't. But here's the good news: **the SHSAT is a learnable test.** Students who prepare strategically and consistently dramatically outperform those who walk in cold.

This isn't a list of vague advice like "study hard" and "believe in yourself." These are 10 concrete, SHSAT-specific strategies that actually move the needle on test day.

## 1. Start with a Diagnostic Test

Before you study a single topic, you need to know where you stand right now. **Take a full-length practice SHSAT under timed conditions** — all 114 questions, 180 minutes, no breaks.

Why this matters:

- **It establishes your baseline score.** Without knowing your starting point, you can't set a realistic target or measure improvement.
- **It reveals your strengths and weaknesses.** Maybe your math is solid but reading comprehension is dragging you down. Or maybe you're strong in ELA but struggling with geometry. The diagnostic tells you where to focus.
- **It prepares you psychologically.** Many students are shocked by the length and difficulty of the SHSAT the first time they see it. Better to experience that shock now than on test day.

**Don't score yourself leniently.** If you weren't sure and guessed, mark it as a guess so you can track which topics need real attention versus which ones you got lucky on.

## 2. Know the Exact SHSAT Format Inside and Out

You'd be surprised how many students walk into the SHSAT without knowing basic facts about the test. Here's what you need to memorize:

| Detail | What You Need to Know |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Total questions** | 114 (57 ELA + 57 Math) |
| **Time limit** | 180 minutes (3 hours) |
| **Calculator** | **Not allowed** |
| **Penalty for wrong answers** | **None** (no negative scoring) |
| **ELA breakdown** | ~20 Revising/Editing + ~37 Reading Comprehension |
| **Math breakdown** | 57 questions covering arithmetic, algebra, geometry, probability/statistics |
| **Answer format** | Multiple choice (4 options per question) |
| **Scoring** | Composite scaled score (not a simple percentage) |

### Why Format Knowledge Matters

Understanding the format lets you make strategic decisions during the test. For example:

- Since there's **no penalty for wrong answers**, you should **never leave a question blank.** Even a random guess gives you a 25% chance.
- Since you have **3 hours for 114 questions**, that's roughly **1 minute and 35 seconds per question.** Some questions will take 30 seconds; others will take 3 minutes. Knowing this helps you manage your time.
- Since **no calculator is allowed**, you need to be fluent in mental math and written computation. Practice doing arithmetic by hand — long division, fraction operations, decimal calculations.

## 3. Master the Most-Tested SHSAT Topics First

Not all topics are equally weighted on the SHSAT. Smart preparation means prioritizing the topics that appear most frequently.

### Math: High-Priority Topics

1. **Algebraic expressions and equations** — solving for variables, word problems with equations, inequalities
2. **Ratios, proportions, and percentages** — these appear in almost every SHSAT
3. **Geometry** — angles, triangles, area, perimeter, volume, coordinate geometry
4. **Number properties** — factors, multiples, primes, divisibility rules
5. **Statistics and probability** — mean, median, mode, basic probability

### ELA: High-Priority Areas

1. **Reading comprehension** — the largest portion of the ELA section by far
2. **Revising/editing** — grammar, sentence structure, paragraph organization, transitions
3. **Vocabulary in context** — not memorizing word lists, but understanding how words function within passages

**Study the high-frequency topics first.** Once you've mastered those, move on to less common areas. This approach maximizes your score improvement per hour of study time.

## 4. Practice Under Timed Conditions

Untimed practice is useful for learning concepts, but it won't prepare you for the real SHSAT. The 3-hour time pressure is one of the biggest challenges of the test, and the only way to get comfortable with it is to practice under realistic conditions.

### How to Build Up to Full Timed Practice

- **Weeks 1-2:** Do individual sections (ELA or Math) with a timer, but give yourself 10-15 extra minutes.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Do individual sections within the actual time limit.
- **Weeks 5+:** Do full-length tests (both sections, 3 hours, no breaks mid-section).
- **Final month:** Take at least one full-length timed practice test per week.

### Timing Strategy for Test Day

- **ELA section:** Spend roughly 10-12 minutes on Revising/Editing, leaving the bulk of your time (about 75-80 minutes) for Reading Comprehension passages.
- **Math section:** Work through easier questions quickly (under 1 minute each) to bank time for harder problems. Don't spend more than 2-3 minutes on any single question — mark it and come back.

## 5. Learn Strategic Guessing (No Penalty for Wrong Answers)

This deserves its own strategy because it's that important: **the SHSAT has no penalty for wrong answers.** Your raw score is simply the number of questions you get right. A wrong answer and a blank answer count exactly the same — zero.

This means:

- **Never leave a question blank.** Ever. Even if you have no idea, guess.
- **If you can eliminate even one answer choice**, your odds improve from 25% to 33%. Eliminate two, and you're at 50%.
- **In the last 5 minutes**, if you have unanswered questions, pick a letter and fill them all in. Random guessing on 10 questions will likely net you 2-3 correct answers — free points.

### The "Two-Pass" Method

1. **First pass:** Go through all questions. Answer everything you can do quickly and confidently. Mark anything that takes more than 90 seconds.
2. **Second pass:** Return to marked questions and work through them carefully.
3. **Final sweep:** Fill in any remaining blanks with your best guess.

## 6. Focus Relentlessly on Your Weakest Areas

This sounds obvious, but most students do the opposite — they practice what they're already good at because it feels productive. Scoring 90% on algebra problems you've already mastered doesn't move your score up. **Grinding through geometry problems that make you uncomfortable does.**

### How to Identify Weak Areas

After every practice test or practice set, categorize your wrong answers:

- **Didn't know the concept** → Need to learn the topic from scratch
- **Made a careless mistake** → Need to slow down and double-check
- **Ran out of time** → Need better time management or faster techniques
- **Misread the question** → Need to practice active reading and underlining key words

Track these patterns over time. If 60% of your math errors are in geometry, that's where you spend your next study sessions.

## 7. Read Actively for ELA (Annotation Strategies)

Passive reading — letting your eyes glaze over the words — is the #1 reason students struggle with SHSAT reading comprehension. Active reading means engaging with the text as you go.

### SHSAT-Specific Annotation Techniques

Since the 2026 SHSAT is going digital, you may not be able to physically underline text. But you can still read actively:

- **Identify the main idea of each paragraph** as you read. Mentally summarize: "This paragraph is about..."
- **Note the author's tone and purpose.** Is the author arguing a point? Explaining a process? Telling a story? Comparing two things?
- **Mark (mentally or on scratch paper) key transitions.** Words like "however," "although," "in contrast," and "moreover" signal shifts in argument or new supporting points.
- **Pay attention to the first and last sentences** of each paragraph — they typically contain the most important information.
- **For poetry passages,** read the entire poem once for general meaning before trying to answer any questions.

### The "Read the Questions First" Debate

Some tutors advise reading the questions before the passage. For the SHSAT, **we recommend reading the passage first** — but quickly. Here's why:

- SHSAT passages are complex. Reading questions first gives you a shopping list of details to find, which can actually slow you down and cause you to miss the big picture.
- Most SHSAT questions test comprehension, inference, and tone — skills that require understanding the passage as a whole.
- **Exception:** For Revising/Editing questions, read the question first since you only need to focus on specific sentences.

## 8. Use Process of Elimination on Every Question

Even when you think you know the answer, take 5 seconds to glance at the other choices and confirm they're wrong. This habit catches mistakes.

### SHSAT-Specific Elimination Tips

**For ELA:**
- Eliminate answers that are too extreme ("The author completely rejects..." when the passage shows nuance)
- Eliminate answers that are true but don't answer the specific question asked
- Eliminate answers that reference information not found in the passage (even if true in real life)

**For Math:**
- Eliminate answers that are clearly too large or too small (use estimation)
- Eliminate answers that don't match the expected format (if the question asks for a fraction and two answers are whole numbers, those are likely wrong)
- Plug answer choices back into the problem — this is often faster than solving algebraically

### The "Definitely Wrong" Technique

On hard questions, don't try to find the right answer first. Instead, find the answers that are **definitely wrong.** Cross them off. Often, you can eliminate 2-3 choices quickly, making the final decision between 1-2 options much more manageable.

## 9. Review Every Wrong Answer — Seriously, Every One

This is where most of the real learning happens, and it's the step most students skip. After every practice set or test, go through **every single question you got wrong** and ask:

1. **What is the correct answer?**
2. **Why is it correct?** Can I explain the reasoning?
3. **Why did I choose the wrong answer?** What was my thinking?
4. **What should I do differently next time?** Is there a concept to review, a strategy to apply, or a careless mistake pattern to fix?

### Keep a Wrong Answer Journal

Maintain a notebook (or digital doc) where you log:

- The question topic (e.g., "geometry — triangle inequality")
- Your wrong answer and why you chose it
- The correct answer and the explanation
- A one-line lesson ("Always check if three sides can form a triangle before calculating area")

Review this journal weekly. You'll start seeing patterns — and those patterns tell you exactly what to study next.

## 10. Take Full-Length Practice Exams Weekly in the Final Month

In the last 4-5 weeks before the SHSAT, your preparation should shift from topic-by-topic study to **full-test simulation.** Aim for one full-length practice test per week.

### Make It Realistic

- **Time it strictly.** 180 minutes. Set a timer. No pausing.
- **No phone, no calculator, no distractions.** Simulate test-day conditions.
- **Use an answer sheet** (or the digital interface if available). Bubbling in answers takes time — factor it into your practice.
- **Take it in the morning** when the real test would be administered, not at 11 PM when you're tired.

### After Each Practice Test

1. Score it immediately.
2. Review every wrong answer (see Strategy #9).
3. Track your score trend. Are you improving? Plateauing? Declining?
4. Adjust your study plan based on results.

**Expected improvement:** Students who follow a structured study plan typically see a **30-70 point improvement** in their composite score over 3-6 months of preparation. Some students improve by 100+ points.

## SHSAT Study Timelines

### The 12-Month Plan (Starting in Fall of 7th Grade)

| Months | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Months 1-3 | Build foundational skills in math and reading. Read widely — novels, nonfiction, news articles. Review core math concepts (fractions, decimals, basic algebra). |
| Months 4-6 | Begin SHSAT-specific prep. Take a diagnostic test. Start working through practice questions by topic. |
| Months 7-9 | Intensify practice. Do timed sections. Focus on weak areas identified in practice tests. |
| Months 10-11 | Full-length practice tests weekly. Fine-tune time management and test-taking strategies. |
| Month 12 | Light review and confidence building. Don't cram. Focus on rest and mental preparation. |

### The 6-Month Plan (Starting in Spring/Summer Before 8th Grade)

| Months | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Month 1 | Diagnostic test + identify weak areas. Create a study schedule (at least 5 hours/week). |
| Months 2-3 | Topic-by-topic study. Work through math concepts systematically. Build ELA reading stamina. |
| Months 4-5 | Timed practice sections. Focus on weak areas. Start full-length practice tests. |
| Month 6 | Weekly full-length tests. Review wrong answers. Light review of all topics. Rest before test day. |

### The 3-Month Plan (Starting in Late Summer)

| Weeks | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Weeks 1-2 | Diagnostic test. Identify your 3-5 weakest topics. Study these intensively (8-10 hours/week). |
| Weeks 3-6 | Mixed practice — timed sections alternating between ELA and Math. Continue drilling weak areas. |
| Weeks 7-10 | Full-length practice tests every weekend. Review all wrong answers. Refine time management. |
| Weeks 11-12 | Final practice test. Light review. Rest and mental preparation. |

**The bottom line:** More time is always better, but even 3 months of focused, strategic preparation can make a significant difference.

## Common SHSAT Study Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Studying Without a Plan
Random practice doesn't work. You need a structured schedule that targets your specific weaknesses.

### 2. Only Doing Math
Many students neglect ELA because math feels more "studyable." But ELA makes up half the test, and reading comprehension skills take time to develop. Start early.

### 3. Never Practicing Under Timed Conditions
Knowing how to solve a problem in 5 minutes doesn't help if you only have 90 seconds on test day.

### 4. Ignoring Wrong Answers
Getting a practice question wrong and just moving on wastes the most valuable learning opportunity you have.

### 5. Cramming the Night Before
The SHSAT tests skills built over months. Last-minute cramming adds stress without adding points. The night before, relax, eat well, and sleep early.

### 6. Using Only One Resource
Different prep materials explain concepts in different ways. If one explanation doesn't click, try another source. Variety helps solidify understanding.

## Important: 2026 SHSAT Changes

The 2026 SHSAT is undergoing a significant transition to a **digital, computer-adaptive test (CAT) format.** Here's what we know so far:

- **The test will be taken on a computer** rather than on paper with a bubble sheet.
- **Computer-adaptive** means the test may adjust question difficulty based on your responses — getting questions right leads to harder questions (worth more), while getting questions wrong leads to easier ones.
- **The core content areas** (ELA and Math) are expected to remain the same.
- **Time limits and question counts** may be adjusted — stay tuned for official DOE announcements.

### What This Means for Your Preparation

The good news: **the underlying skills being tested haven't changed.** You still need strong reading comprehension, solid grammar knowledge, and robust math skills. The strategies in this guide still apply.

The adjustment: Practice with digital tools when possible. Get comfortable reading passages and solving problems on a screen. If the CAT format is confirmed, focus on accuracy over speed — adaptive tests reward getting questions right more than answering many questions.
