# Free SHSAT Practice Tests 2026: 15+ Resources to Prep Without Breaking the Bank

Preparing for the SHSAT doesn't have to cost hundreds of dollars. While premium prep courses and private tutoring can be effective, many families successfully prepare their students using free resources that are just as comprehensive—and sometimes more current—than expensive alternatives.

## When to Consider Paid Resources

While free resources can be highly effective, consider supplementing with paid materials if:

- Your student needs more structured guidance
- Free resources don't address specific weak areas
- You want more practice tests than available for free
- Your timeline is very short (less than 2 months)

## Red Flags: Free Resources to Avoid

**Watch out for:**
- Outdated materials (pre-2017 SHSAT format)
- Unofficial "SHSAT" tests that don't match actual format
- Resources promising "guaranteed" score improvements
- Platforms requiring excessive personal information

## Making the Most of Your Prep Investment

Remember, the most expensive prep course won't help a student who doesn't put in consistent effort. Free resources paired with:
- Regular practice schedules
- Consistent effort
- Strategic focus on weak areas
- Realistic goal setting

...often outperform expensive courses with inconsistent use.
