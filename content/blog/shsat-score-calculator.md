# SHSAT Score Calculator 2026: How Your Score Is Calculated

One of the most common questions SHSAT students and parents ask is: **"How is the SHSAT scored?"** and **"What score do I need to get into Stuyvesant / Bronx Science / Brooklyn Tech?"**

Use our free calculator above to estimate your scaled score based on how many questions you get right — and instantly see which specialized high schools you'd qualify for.

## How SHSAT Scoring Works

Understanding SHSAT scoring is crucial for setting realistic goals and tracking your progress.

### Raw Scores vs. Scaled Scores

The SHSAT has two sections — **ELA (English Language Arts)** and **Math** — with **57 questions each**. However, not all questions count toward your score:

- **47 questions per section are scored** (these determine your raw score)
- **10 questions per section are experimental** "field test" questions that don't count
- You **won't know** which questions are experimental — so answer every single one

Your **raw score** (number of scored questions you got right) is then converted to a **scaled score** using a conversion formula that changes each year based on test difficulty.

### The Conversion Formula

The NYC DOE doesn't publish exact conversion tables, but here's what we know from official documentation:

| Score Range | Points per Additional Correct Answer |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Middle range (most students) | ~3-4 scaled points per correct answer |
| Very high scores (top performers) | ~10-20 scaled points per correct answer |
| Very low scores | ~10-20 scaled points per correct answer |

Each section produces a scaled score from approximately **200 to 350**. Your two section scores are added together to create your **composite score** (max ~700).

### Why 10 Questions Don't Count

The DOE includes 10 experimental questions in each section to test new question formats and difficulties for future exams. These questions are mixed randomly throughout the test — there's no way to identify them. This is why:

- You should **never skip a question** — it might be experimental
- There's **no penalty for wrong answers** — always guess
- Two students with the same number correct might get slightly different scaled scores

## 2025 SHSAT Cutoff Scores

Cutoff scores change every year based on the applicant pool. Here are the most recent official cutoffs:

| School | 2025 Cutoff | Est. Raw Score Needed |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Stuyvesant High School | 556 | ~90% correct |
| Staten Island Technical HS | 527 | ~88% |
| HSMSE at City College | 526 | ~88% |
| Bronx High School of Science | 518 | ~87% |
| Queens Science at York College | 518 | ~87% |
| Brooklyn Technical HS | 505 | ~85% |
| American Studies at Lehman | 504 | ~85% |
| The Brooklyn Latin School | 496 | ~84% |

### What Makes Cutoffs Change?

Cutoff scores fluctuate based on:
- **Number of applicants** — more competition = higher cutoffs
- **Test difficulty** — harder tests = lower raw score thresholds
- **Student preferences** — which schools are most popular that year
- **Available seats** — changes in capacity at each school

### A Realistic Target

For **any** specialized high school offer, aim to answer at least **80-85% of questions correctly** across both sections. For Stuyvesant, you'll need closer to **90%+**.

## Tips to Maximize Your Score

1. **Never leave a question blank.** No penalty for guessing — a 25% chance is better than 0%.
2. **Balance your sections.** A 340 in Math and 220 in ELA (560) beats a perfect 350 in Math and 200 in ELA (550).
3. **Focus on your weaker section.** Improving from 250 to 290 in your weak section gains you 40 points — that's often easier than going from 330 to 350 in your strong section.
4. **Practice under timed conditions.** You have 180 minutes for 114 questions — that's about 90 seconds per question.
