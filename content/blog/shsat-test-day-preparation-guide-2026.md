## Strategic Test Day Performance Tips

### ELA Section Success Strategies

**Reading Comprehension Approach:**
1. **Read passage first, questions second** (don't skim questions first)
2. **Annotate directly in test booklet** - underline key ideas, circle transitions
3. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers** before selecting best option
4. **Trust your first instinct** on close-call questions

**Time Management for ELA:**
- Spend no more than 12-15 minutes per reading passage
- If stuck on a question, mark it and return later
- Save 10 minutes at the end for review and final checks

### Math Section Success Strategies

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
1. **Read each question twice** before solving
2. **Work backwards from answer choices** when stuck
3. **Estimate answers** to check reasonableness
4. **Use test booklet margins** for all calculations

**Grid-In Question Strategy:**
- These are typically the hardest questions (save for last)
- Double-check decimal placement
- Fractions don't need to be reduced to lowest terms
- Leave no blank spaces in grid

### Universal Test-Taking Tactics

**Energy Management:**
- Take 30-second breathing breaks every 20 questions
- Sit up straight to maintain alertness
- Stretch neck and shoulders during breaks

**Answer Sheet Management:**
- Transfer answers every 10 questions (not after each one)
- Fill bubbles completely and erase cleanly
- Double-check question numbers match answer sheet

**Stress Management:**
- If you feel overwhelmed, take 3 deep breaths
- Remember: one question won't determine your entire future
- Focus on the question in front of you, not your overall performance

## Common Test Day Mistakes to Avoid

### Before the Test
**❌ Staying up late cramming** - Get 8+ hours of sleep instead
**❌ Eating sugary breakfast** - Choose protein and complex carbs
**❌ Arriving without backup supplies** - Bring extra of everything
**❌ Reviewing difficult concepts morning-of** - Stick to confidence boosters

### During the Test
**❌ Spending too long on one question** - Move on and return later
**❌ Changing answers impulsively** - Only change if you find an error
**❌ Leaving questions blank** - No penalty for wrong answers, always guess
**❌ Trying new strategies** - Use techniques you've practiced

### Answer Sheet Errors
**❌ Misaligned bubbling** - Check question numbers frequently  
**❌ Incomplete bubble fills** - Darken completely
**❌ Multiple bubbles per question** - Erase completely before changing
**❌ Writing outside bubble areas** - Invalidates machine scoring

**If you feel sick:**
- Inform proctor immediately

## Post-Test: What Happens Next?

### Immediate Aftermath
