She had been working on this problem for eleven years, through two universities, one divorce, and countless sleepless nights. Her graduate students had come and gone, each contributing a small piece. Now, standing alone in the lab at 2 a.m., she could see how all the pieces fit together. She should have felt triumphant. Instead, she felt something closer to grief. The problem had been her constant companion, her North Star. Solving it meant losing the thing that had defined her for over a decade. She capped the marker and sat down heavily. Tomorrow she would celebrate. Tonight, she would mourn.",

Or maybe she was bigger now—twelve years old and folded into a space meant for coats and umbrellas, her knees pressed against the door, her back against the wall. She could hear the footsteps in the hallway, slow and deliberate. Not her mother's quick, purposeful stride or her brother's careless thudding. These footsteps belonged to someone who was looking. Alia held her breath and counted her heartbeats: one, two, three, four. The footsteps stopped outside the closet door. A shadow broke the line of light at the bottom. Alia's heart was at forty-seven when the shadow moved on. She didn't exhale until sixty.",

We always let them go before bed. \"Everything deserves to be free,\" Grandma said. She sold the house last year. I drove past it on the way to somewhere else and almost didn't recognize it.
