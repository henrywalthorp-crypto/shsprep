      "title": "The Quiet Power of Jury Duty",
      "text": "Most Americans dread the pale envelope from the county courthouse. Jury duty, they grumble, is an inconvenience—a disruption to work schedules, childcare arrangements, and personal plans. Yet this civic obligation, established in the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution, represents one of the most direct ways ordinary citizens shape the justice system.\n\nThe right to a trial by jury was not an afterthought. English colonists carried memories of the Star Chamber, a secretive royal court that tried defendants without juries and often without fairness. When the framers drafted the Bill of Rights, they insisted that both criminal and civil cases could be heard by panels of everyday people rather than government-appointed judges alone. The jury box, in their view, was a checkpoint against tyranny.\n\nIn practice, the system works like this: eligible adults are randomly selected from voter-registration rolls, driver's-license databases, or tax records. Those who are called report to a courthouse, where attorneys for each side question them during a process called voir dire. Prospective jurors who show obvious bias or conflict of interest are dismissed; the rest are seated. Once a trial begins, jurors hear evidence, deliberate in private, and render a verdict that can alter lives.\n\nCritics argue that the modern jury system is flawed. Juror pay—often as low as fifteen dollars per day—creates a financial hardship that falls disproportionately on hourly workers. Some scholars contend that complex cases involving forensic accounting or biotechnology exceed the understanding of untrained citizens. Others point to studies showing that implicit biases related to race, class, and appearance can influence verdicts despite judges' instructions to remain impartial.\n\nDefenders counter that these problems call for reform, not abolition. Raising juror compensation, providing clearer expert testimony, and diversifying jury pools are achievable steps. Moreover, they argue, the alternative—leaving all decisions to professional judges—concentrates power in ways the founders explicitly feared.\n\nUltimately, jury duty asks citizens to do something remarkable: set aside personal comfort and render judgment on behalf of their community. It is slow, imperfect, and sometimes tedious. It is also, as one legal historian noted, 'democracy in its most granular form.' Whether that phrase inspires pride or a sigh may depend on how recently one received that pale envelope.",

      "title": "The Height of the Fence",
      "text": "The summer Marisol turned thirteen, the chain-link fence between her yard and Mr. Gustafson's seemed to shrink. She had always thought of it as enormous—an impassable wall separating her world of bicycles and popsicle-stained fingers from his silent kingdom of rose bushes and birdbaths. But now, standing on the balls of her feet, she could see clear over the top rail, and the roses looked less like forbidden treasure and more like plants that needed watering.\n\nMr. Gustafson had lived alone for as long as anyone on Delancey Street could remember. Neighborhood legend held that he had once been a jazz musician, though no one had heard him play. He communicated mainly through frowns aimed at children who kicked soccer balls too close to his fence and through the occasional nod at Mrs. Pak when she brought him soup in winter.\n\nMarisol's mother had always warned her to leave the old man alone. 'He likes his quiet,' she would say, as though quiet were something solid, something you could wrap in tissue paper and place on a shelf. Marisol had obeyed, mostly, until the Wednesday afternoon she spotted the garden hose running unattended across his front walk, water pooling near the porch steps. She watched for ten minutes, waiting for him to appear. When he didn't, she climbed the fence.\n\nThe door was open a crack. She called out twice before stepping inside. The living room smelled like old newspapers and coffee. Mr. Gustafson sat in a recliner near the window, his left foot wrapped in a beige bandage, a cane propped against the armrest. He looked at her the way a cat regards a new piece of furniture—warily, with the faintest curiosity.\n\n'Your hose is on,' she said.\n\n'I know,' he replied. 'Can't walk to turn it off.'\n\nShe turned off the hose, then came back and stood in the doorway, unsure whether to leave. On a shelf behind him sat a brass trumpet, dull with tarnish but unmistakable. He followed her gaze.\n\n'Haven't touched it in twelve years,' he said, as if answering a question she hadn't asked.\n\nMarisol came back the next day, and the day after that. She weeded the rose beds. She carried groceries. She asked questions he mostly didn't answer. But one evening, as she was leaving, she heard a sound through the screen door—thin, uncertain, like a voice remembering how to speak. A single note from a trumpet, held until it filled the yard and drifted over the fence that no longer seemed to separate anything at all.",
